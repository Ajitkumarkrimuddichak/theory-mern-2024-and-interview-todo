Question :- Error Boundaries in React.js ?

Answer :- Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript 
errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and 
display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error
boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in 
constructors of the whole tree below them.

Note:- Not Work Error Boundaries ?
(i) Event handlers (learn more)
(ii) Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks)
(iii) Server side rendering
(iv) Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)

Note :- Work Error Boundaries ?
(i) getDerivedStateFromError() 
(ii) componentDidCatch().
